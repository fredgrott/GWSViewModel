GWSViewModel
---

There are times when you do not need a full application architecture as the application is small in
nature or is not very complex. These cases may call for only maintaining the view state during an
orientation change.for example.

Thus, view model can help in persisting the state during orientation changes. Nice and small compact
library to be standalone and do one thing extremely well. At this time it's not event base driven to keep
it simple.
